This repo is all about how to get started with Machine Learning and all the tricks required to perform necessary task and how to make a model.

Here we have taken the famous `Iris Dataset` as our running example. This is a very simple and easy dataset to get started with ML.

## Stepping into the world of ML in the right way ‚úîÔ∏è

## Libraries Used :

### Task 1:

To perform the following tasks:

1.  To make PDFs and CDFs of Iris flower based on their species.
2.  To make the Violinplots of Iris flower based on their species.
3.  To make the boxplots of Iris flower based on their species.
4.  To quantify the resulting plots on own words.
